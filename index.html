			<p>Subedar Tamash Ranjan Mandal(Retired) my father, served 30 years in the indian army,He served his country and its people.He then after retirement returns to his home village ,where he wants to build a house for his family, But is stopped by his distant relatives who forcefully want a piece of his and his brother's (Tapan Kumar Mandal) land so that they can build a private road on it.
			</p>
			<h5><u>Dispute</u></h5>
			<p>The plot 3507/4746 is divided between 3 people </p>
			<ol>
				<li>Tapan Mandal (711) 7 Decimal</li>
				<li>Tamash Ranjan Mandal (727/1) 6 Decimal</li>
				<li>Bhabatosh Mondal (1455/1) 1 Decimal</li>
			</ol>
			<p><b>Bhabatosh Mondal</b> has used 1 decimal of his land and also forcefully aquired some of ours too, For which my uncle(Tapan Mandal) has filled a police <a href=".\complaint.html">Complaint</a>.He and his band of relatives are saying that long ago this land used to have a real road which is not possible because our old family had a house there(Old constuction material is still present)</p><br>

			at Haldia SDO Court ,West Bengal, Because of Which the Incharge in the Nandigram police sation has 
			<b>Verbally</b>told us not to do any Construction .Even after we presented the ownership of the land and The <a href=".\permit.html">Permit To construct a House</a> to the police , they took no actions </p>
			<p>1. Not being able to build a House on his own Legally owned Land with a false case against him
			is taking a toll on my fathers Mental and Physical Health.</p>
			<p>2. He is not asking for anything but his fundamental rights.</p>
			<p>3. Not Asking nor begging anyone to provide land , Just the freedom to build a house on his own
			legal land</p>
